'@civitai/components-chat': patch
---

`<civitai-chat>` no longer calls `/api/v1/me` inside a civitai.com block. That route accepts an OAuth token but refuses the block-scoped one, so a block on the default token sent a request that failed on every mount and showed no name. In a block the chat now takes the viewer's name from the host (`app.viewer.username`), which needs no request and no consent. Outside a block it still asks `/me`, as before.
