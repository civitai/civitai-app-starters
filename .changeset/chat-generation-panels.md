Panels: the assistant can build a set of controls for one kind of generation (`open_panel`) that the viewer runs as often as they like, straight on the orchestrator and without an assistant reply each time. It sees the panel's values and runs when asked for help, and changes it in place (`update_panel`). Panels use content-studios' input kinds and a `run_step`/`run_workflow` template, keep every version and the exact values of each run, and are saved with the conversation. Share copies a link that opens a copy of the panel in the viewer's own conversation (`openPanel()`, `holdSharedPanel()`, `panel-link-base`). `dock-panels` and `<civitai-chat-studio>` show a panel studio-style beside the chat.
