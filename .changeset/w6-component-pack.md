feat(blocks-react): W6 component pack — `@civitai/blocks-react/ui` opinionated UI components

Adds a zero-setup, Civitai-looking component pack to the `/ui` subexport so external App Block authors get coherent UI inside the iframe without a Mantine dependency or a CSS import step.

- **Ten components**, each in its own file under `src/ui/`: `Button`, `TextInput`, `Textarea`, `Card`, `Stack`, `Group`, `Alert`, `Loader`, `Badge`, `Modal`. Each forwards `className` + `style` and a `ref` (where it wraps a DOM node), exports its TS props interface, and carries a `data-civitai-ui="<name>"` styling/test hook.
- **Zero setup.** The pack ships its CSS as a TS string constant (`BLOCKS_UI_STYLES`) and injects it into the block document's `<head>` once, idempotently, the first time any component renders — the build is `tsc`-only (no bundler, no CSS pipeline), so there's nothing for the author to import or wire up. `injectBlocksStyles(doc?)` (manual/SSR) and the `useBlocksStyles()` hook are exported too.
- **Auto-themed via your block's `data-theme`** (gotcha #60). Tokens are CSS custom properties (`--ci-*`) under `:root`, flipped by `[data-theme='dark']`; no attribute = light, matching the starter palette. The host can't reach across the iframe, so the block sets `data-theme={theme}` on its own root and the pack reads the ancestor selector.
- **Accessibility baked in:** inputs link label/description/error via `htmlFor` + `aria-describedby` + `aria-invalid`; `Alert` is `role="alert"`; `Loader` is `role="status"`; `Modal` is `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal`, closes on Escape and overlay click, focuses its panel on open and restores focus on close. (Modal does not trap focus in v0 — a documented v1 follow-up.)

`SettingsForm` is unchanged (it intentionally keeps its unstyled-native contract and is host-themed; migrating it to the pack is a separate change). No new runtime dependencies. 92 new behavior-driven tests.
