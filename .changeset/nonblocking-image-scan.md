Add the non-blocking (async-scan) cosmetic-image upload flow for App Blocks: the host early-resolves the upload modal on persist and streams the scan verdict to the block, so a display upload no longer blocks on the scan.

- **app-sdk (`@civitai/app-sdk/blocks`):** new `BlockPendingImageInfo` (`{ status: 'pending', imageId, url }` — an author-preview-only early-resolve handle) and `BlockImageScanResult` (the discriminated async verdict `scanned` | `blocked` | `error`), both re-exported from the blocks barrel. `OPEN_IMAGE_UPLOAD` gains an opt-in `asyncScan?: boolean` (absent/false = byte-compatible blocking path); `IMAGE_UPLOAD_RESULT.selected` widens to also carry the pending handle; and a new parent→block `IMAGE_SCAN_RESOLVED` message delivers the verdict (correlated by `requestId` + `imageId`). Only the `scanned` verdict carries a usable moderated image.
- **blocks-react:** `useImageUpload({ asyncScan: true })` returns `{ open, scanStatus }` — `open()` early-resolves a `BlockPendingImageInfo` (or `null` on dismiss) and `scanStatus(handle)` resolves the streamed verdict (buffered if it arrives first; re-callable for retry; forgery-resistant correlation by the generated `requestId`). Existing overloads (blocking `display`, `generationSource`) are unchanged. A host that predates `asyncScan` (blocking-resolves a moderated image) is handled transparently — the hook treats it as immediately-scanned. `createMockHost` models the early-resolve → async verdict with a new `cannedImageScan` option (`'scanned'` default | `{ status: 'blocked', reason? }` | `'error'`).
- The block-side security invariant is unchanged: the pending handle is author-preview-only, only a `scanned` verdict carries the moderated image projection, and cross-user serving stays gated server-side.

blocks-react bumps its `@civitai/app-sdk` peer range `^0.21.0` → `^0.22.0` in lockstep (it consumes the new types), so the app-sdk minor does not force a blocks-react major.
