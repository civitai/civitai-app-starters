dev:live picker no longer seeds a model card thumbnail from a VIDEO cover — picks the first IMAGE-type media instead (a video url in an <img> downloaded the full ~73 MB mp4 and rendered nothing; the edge transcode-to-jpeg trick doesn't defuse it). Video-only versions fall through to the neutral placeholder.
