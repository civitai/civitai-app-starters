# @civitai/components-chat

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- No source change. This records the version that is actually on the registry.

  `0.1.0` — this package's first-ever publish — FAILED in CI with
  `E404 Not Found - PUT https://registry.npmjs.org/@civitai%2fcomponents-chat`
  (release run 36747192297). Under npm OIDC trusted publishing that 404 means
  "unauthorized", and it is unavoidable on a first publish: a trusted publisher
  cannot be configured for a package the registry does not know yet, so there was
  nothing for the workflow's OIDC handshake to match. The other five packages in
  that run published normally — `changeset publish` continues past a failing
  package — so only this one was left behind.
  `0.1.1` was then published by hand from a maintainer's machine to bootstrap the
  name (npm user `devzacx`, 2026-09-30T18:01:58Z, no provenance attestations,
  unlike every other `@civitai/*` package), and the accompanying version bump was
  never committed.

  That left `main` permanently red: the tree said `0.1.0`, the registry held only
  `0.1.1`, so `pnpm assert:published` correctly reported
  `PUBLISH DID NOT HAPPEN — a package version in this tree is not on the registry.`
  on every push, blocking the release signal for every other package. Recording
  `0.1.1` here makes `changeset publish` skip the package as already-published and
  lets the assertion pass.

  🔴 **Still outstanding, and this bump does not fix it:** `@civitai/components-chat`
  has no GitHub Actions trusted publisher on npmjs.com. Until one is configured
  (owner `civitai`, repo `civitai-app-starters`, workflow `release.yml`,
  environment blank — the same trust the other six packages already have), the
  next changeset that bumps this package will fail to publish with the same E404.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 407251d: New package: `<civitai-chat>`, a Civitai assistant as one element, the companion to `@civitai/components` for pages that want a chat that makes images, video and music on the viewer's Buzz. `@civitai/components-chat/civitai-chat/define` registers it; the agent loads lazily once the chat has a signed-in `AppClient`. A page hands over its own client (`app`) or lets the chat sign in on the first message (`signIn`, with `popupSignIn(auth)` built on `SignIn.signInWithPopup()`). Page tools, instructions, prompt, MCP switches, scope, layout and a welcome slot are the embedding API.
