### Patch Changes

- 67c8c2e: dev:live picker grid no longer collapses its rows (align-content:start + grid-auto-rows:max-content) — fixes broken cards, missing thumbnails, and lag

## 0.14.2

### Patch Changes

- eed9cf8: dev:live picker lazy-loads thumbnails (no freeze) + scroll-bounds the grid + smaller page

## 0.14.1

### Patch Changes

- 49416ec: dev:live picker filters resources by family server-side instead of starving a single generic page

## 0.14.0

### Minor Changes

- 3086d68: dev:live live host now serves App-Storage KV + forwards SET_USER_CHECKPOINT against the real backend

## 0.13.2

### Patch Changes

- 56ad26c: fix(pickers): give resource/checkpoint picker requests a human-interactive timeout

  `useCheckpointPicker().open()` / `useResourcePicker().open()` used the default
  ~30s request timeout — but a picker waits for the USER to browse + choose, so a
  slow pick rejected mid-flow with "request OPEN\_\*\_PICKER timed out after 30000ms"
  and the selection was lost. They now use a generous 10-minute bound (the host
  still resolves earlier on pick/dismiss/close). Fake-timer regression test:
  advancing 60s no longer rejects the open() promise.

## 0.13.1

### Patch Changes

- 0826d32: fix(live host): bind the default fetch to globalThis

  `createLiveHost`'s default fetch was the bare `globalThis.fetch` reference;
  called detached it throws "Illegal invocation" in browsers (fetch is a
  DOM-bound builtin), which broke the catalog/picker overlay and every live-host
  network call when no `fetchImpl` was supplied. The default now wraps it so the
  call is always bound. Regression test asserts the global fetch is invoked with
  `this === globalThis`.

## 0.13.0

### Minor Changes

- b47ca66: Live host (`createLiveHost`, used by `dev:live`) now SERVES the resource pickers locally instead of stubbing them. On `OPEN_CHECKPOINT_PICKER` / `OPEN_RESOURCE_PICKER` it opens an in-harness catalog-browser overlay (real models fetched with the dev block token via `/api/v1/blocks/models`, public `/api/v1/models` fallback), the dev picks one, and the host replies with a real `BlockCheckpointInfo` / `BlockResourceInfo` in the exact shape the production host returns — so `useCheckpointPicker()` / `useResourcePicker()` are byte-identical in `dev:live` and in production (protocol fidelity, not chrome fidelity). Honors the request filters (`baseModelGroup`/ecosystem, `resourceType`, `currentVersionId` pre-highlight). A pick is discovery only — the server re-validates and prices every id at estimate/submit. Production is unchanged; this only fills in a local dev-host capability.

## 0.12.4

### Patch Changes

- 1f02b7b: Dev harness: restyle the fixed `DEV HARNESS` info strip to a minimal console / terminal aesthetic (dark terminal slab, monospace, subtle accent top border, dim chrome text with brighter accents on the live `viewer/consent/theme/outbound` values). Presentation-only — all content, the expand/collapse toggle, positioning, and pointer-events behavior are unchanged. This strip is shared chrome rendered by every block app's `dev:harness`.

## 0.12.3

### Patch Changes

- fe87382: fix(live host): surface read-only dev tokens instead of silently dead-ending

  A dev token minted from an OAuth login carries no `ai:write:budgeted` scope, so
  the block's `granted` is false and clicking Generate posts `REQUEST_CONSENT` —
  which `createLiveHost` previously swallowed as a silent no-op (live mode can't
  grant a scope the token lacks). Result: Generate did nothing, with no network,
  no console output, no error.

  Now the live host (1) logs a prominent, actionable warning at install when the
  token lacks the budgeted scope ("READ-ONLY … re-mint with `civitai login
--token <key>`"), and (2) logs a clear error on `REQUEST_CONSENT` instead of
  swallowing it. No protocol/API change — it can't grant the missing scope, but
  it no longer fails silently.

## 0.12.2

### Patch Changes

- 8989d94: Mock host: label the default synthetic generation result image as `MOCK`.

  When a block runs in `dev:harness` with no custom `generation.image(s)` configured, the mock host returns a `placehold.co` placeholder for the succeeded workflow. It previously showed only the last 4 chars of the workflow id, which looked like a real (or broken) result — a first-run developer who ran `civitai app create` → `npm run dev:harness` → Generate reported mistaking it for a real generation. The placeholder now prominently reads `MOCK` (with the short workflow id retained on a second line for per-gen uniqueness), so the scaffolded result is unmistakably a mock.

## 0.12.1

### Patch Changes

- 8113fd0: Alert: derive the ARIA live-region role from `color` instead of always using `role="alert"`.

  `error`/`warning` keep `role="alert"` (assertive, interrupts), while `info`/`success` now use `role="status"` (polite) so a static, always-present callout (e.g. a "How this works" panel on mount) is no longer announced assertively to screen-reader users. A new `role?` prop on `AlertProps` overrides the color-derived default (explicit value always wins). Backward-compatible for `error`/`warning`.

## 0.12.0

### Minor Changes

- 0554f63: feat(blocks-react): W6 component pack — `@civitai/blocks-react/ui` opinionated UI components

  Adds a zero-setup, Civitai-looking component pack to the `/ui` subexport so external App Block authors get coherent UI inside the iframe without a Mantine dependency or a CSS import step.

  - **Ten components**, each in its own file under `src/ui/`: `Button`, `TextInput`, `Textarea`, `Card`, `Stack`, `Group`, `Alert`, `Loader`, `Badge`, `Modal`. Each forwards `className` + `style` and a `ref` (where it wraps a DOM node), exports its TS props interface, and carries a `data-civitai-ui="<name>"` styling/test hook.
  - **Zero setup.** The pack ships its CSS as a TS string constant (`BLOCKS_UI_STYLES`) and injects it into the block document's `<head>` once, idempotently, the first time any component renders — the build is `tsc`-only (no bundler, no CSS pipeline), so there's nothing for the author to import or wire up. `injectBlocksStyles(doc?)` (manual/SSR) and the `useBlocksStyles()` hook are exported too.
  - **Auto-themed via your block's `data-theme`** (gotcha #60). Tokens are CSS custom properties (`--ci-*`) under `:root`, flipped by `[data-theme='dark']`; no attribute = light, matching the starter palette. The host can't reach across the iframe, so the block sets `data-theme={theme}` on its own root and the pack reads the ancestor selector.
  - **Accessibility baked in:** inputs link label/description/error via `htmlFor` + `aria-describedby` + `aria-invalid`; `Alert` is `role="alert"`; `Loader` is `role="status"`; `Modal` is `role="dialog"` + `aria-modal`, closes on Escape and overlay click, focuses its panel on open and restores focus on close. (Modal does not trap focus in v0 — a documented v1 follow-up.)

  `SettingsForm` is unchanged (it intentionally keeps its unstyled-native contract and is host-themed; migrating it to the pack is a separate change). No new runtime dependencies. 92 new behavior-driven tests.

## 0.11.2

### Patch Changes

- 735b08f: fix(testing): `createLiveHost` no longer turns a transient poll transport error into a terminal `failed` workflow.

  `dev:live` polls a workflow via the `blocks.pollWorkflow` tRPC mutation. Previously, ANY non-2xx response or network throw on a poll (a not-yet-rolled-out backend pod 401ing for a few seconds, a momentary network hiccup, a 5xx blip) was fabricated into a terminal `WORKFLOW_STATUS` snapshot with `status: 'failed'` — so a generation that succeeded server-side showed as FAILED in the block and the poll loop stopped. The round-5 dogfood hit exactly this (its success needed manual retries past bad pods).

  The poll path now distinguishes a transport/infra blip from a genuine workflow failure: a real workflow failure is a 200 response whose snapshot is `status: 'failed'` (forwarded as-is, terminal), whereas any non-2xx / network throw is a transport error. Transport errors are retried with bounded exponential backoff (up to 4 attempts, ~1.75s worst case). If the backend stays unreachable after the retries, the host replies with a NON-terminal `processing` snapshot carrying the transient error (so the block's own poll loop keeps polling and the real outcome can still surface) — never a synthesized terminal `failed`. `ESTIMATE`/`SUBMIT`/`CANCEL` behavior is unchanged.

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- f20d590: docs: repoint the dead `developer.civitai.com/docs/blocks` README link

  The dev portal has no App Blocks section, so the intro link returned 404. Point
  it at the real, public "Build your first App Block" guide in this repo instead.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- c8d928c: feat(testing): add `createLiveHost` — the LIVE sibling of `createMockHost`. Where the mock host synthesizes every reply with no network, `createLiveHost` FORWARDS the App-Block postMessage protocol to the REAL Civitai backend using a short-lived, pasted dev block token (minted via `POST /api/v1/blocks/dev-token`), so a harness's `dev:live` mode runs local block code against real compute / real Buzz / the real catalog (Phase 2 of the dev-token live-mode design).

  It returns the same `{ install, setScenario, buzz }` interface as `createMockHost` (so a harness can swap them; `setScenario`/`buzz` are inert in live mode). On install it decodes the token JWT payload (no signature verification) to seed `BLOCK_INIT`, fetches the viewer via `GET /api/v1/blocks/me`, and forwards `ESTIMATE/SUBMIT/POLL/CANCEL_WORKFLOW` to the corresponding `blocks.*` tRPC mutations (Bearer = block token), mapping `BlockWorkflowSnapshot` back to the right reply keyed by `requestId`. Backend/network errors map to a failed-shape snapshot (never a hung promise). `OPEN_BUZZ_PURCHASE` deep-links to the real purchase page and replies `purchased: false` (honest — the out-of-band purchase isn't observable). Pickers / `SET_USER_CHECKPOINT` / the app-storage KV protocol reply with a clearly-labelled "not supported in live v1" outcome. Accepts an injectable `fetchImpl` for tests.

  Exported from `@civitai/blocks-react/testing` as `createLiveHost`, `decodeBlockTokenPayload`, and the `LiveHostOptions` type.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- f87da00: fix(testing): the dev `Harness` log badge no longer overlaps or intercepts the block's own bottom content. The fixed bottom-right badge now reserves matching bottom padding on the harness frame and is `pointer-events: none` (re-enabled only on the summary/log), so clicks on a block's last row of controls (e.g. action buttons) land on the controls instead of the badge.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 216f3ca: `createMockHost`: rich, configurable scenario controls for local-dev DX (Layer 1).

  The mock host now lets a block dev exercise the full money / error / storage UX
  locally — synthetically, with no real Buzz and no network. All additions are
  optional and backward-compatible (existing `createMockHost({ viewer })` calls and
  the legacy `cost` / `failMode` / `buzzBudget` / `pollsUntilDone` knobs are
  unchanged).

  - **`generation`** scenario: `costPerGen` (number or `(body) => number`),
    `latencyMs` (number or `[min, max]`), `failRate` (0..1), `failNext` (fail the
    next N submits), and `image` / `images` (custom result URLs). Simulate real
    costs, slow gens, and failures.
  - **`buzz`** scenario: `balance` (a simulated spendable wallet — a gen that would
    exceed it returns an insufficient-Buzz outcome; successes debit it; a top-up
    refills it) and `insufficient` (force the insufficient path). Exercise the
    top-up / insufficient UX.
  - **`storage`** scenario + a working in-memory KV backend: the mock host now
    answers the full `APP_STORAGE_*` protocol (`get` / `set` / `delete` / `list`
    with cursor pagination / `getQuota`), with `seed`, `quotaBytes`,
    `valueCapBytes`, and `failNext` knobs. W4 KV apps (e.g. Prompt Library) can
    test load / quota / error states against `createMockHost` directly instead of
    hand-injecting a fake store.
  - **Runtime handle**: `createMockHost(...)` now returns `setScenario(patch)` plus
    a `buzz` handle (`getBalance()` / `setBalance(n)`) so a harness UI can flip
    scenarios mid-session.
  - `readMockHostUrlOptions` maps new query params onto the scenarios:
    `?balance`, `?insufficient`, `?latency` (`2000` or `500-2000`), `?costPerGen`,
    `?failNext`, `?failRate`, `?seed=<json>`.

  The mock host remains pure + synthetic (a test asserts the full protocol never
  calls `fetch`).

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 37d8465: Add `useDomainMaturity()` and `<SfwGate>` for reading the surrounding
  color-domain's maturity ceiling. `useDomainMaturity()` returns
  `{ domain, maxBrowsingLevel, isSfw, isLevelAllowed(level) }` from the same init
  state as `useBlockContext`, deriving `isSfw` from the `maxBrowsingLevel` bitmask
  (host PR #2670) and **failing closed to SFW** before `BLOCK_INIT` / when the host
  omits the field. `<SfwGate>` renders its children only when the domain is SFW (or
  when a given `level` is allowed), else an optional `fallback`. `createMockHost`
  now emits `domain`/`maxBrowsingLevel` on `BLOCK_INIT` (driven by `domain`,
  `maxBrowsingLevel`, or a `maturity: 'sfw'|'mature'` convenience) so the hook and
  gate are exercisable in tests and the dev harness. Additive only; forward-
  compatible (works before #2670 deploys). Requires `@civitai/app-sdk` >=0.13.0
  (for `isSfwCeiling`/`isLevelAllowed`/`ColorDomain` and the `browsingLevel`
  constants); the peer-dependency constraint is bumped accordingly.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- eca1252: Add `createMockHost()` + a React `<Harness>` (a.k.a. `<MockHostProvider>`) to the `@civitai/blocks-react/testing` subpath.

  `createMockHost()` is a framework-agnostic, test-and-dev-only fake of the civitai.com embedding host. It patches `window.parent.postMessage`, dispatches a configurable `BLOCK_INIT`, and answers the full block protocol — `REQUEST_TOKEN`, the lazy-consent `REQUEST_CONSENT` → `TOKEN_REFRESH` round-trip, `ESTIMATE_WORKFLOW`, `SUBMIT_WORKFLOW`, `POLL_WORKFLOW` (processing ×N → succeeded with image + cost), `OPEN_BUZZ_PURCHASE`, `OPEN_CHECKPOINT_PICKER`, and `OPEN_RESOURCE_PICKER` (canned picks). It is driven by an options object (`viewer`, `consentGranted`, `failMode`, `cannedPicks`, `pollsUntilDone`, `cost`, `theme`, `context`, + forward-compat `domain`/`maturity`) and also honors the dev URL toggles (`?viewer/?consent/?fail/?theme/?pick/?pickCkpt`). It returns an `{ install(): uninstall }` handle so it works from node/jsdom/happy-dom tests as well as a browser dev harness.

  `<Harness>` is a thin React wrapper that installs the mock host on mount (cleanup on unmount) and optionally renders the on-screen message-log panel.

  This replaces the ~250-line hand-rolled per-block harness. Test/dev-only — no change to the block runtime API or money/transport semantics. The existing `resetTransport` / `mockParentMessage` testing exports are unchanged.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 6ba78fa: Add the PAGE resource picker (Design 1 — host-chrome): `useResourcePicker()` +
  the `OPEN_RESOURCE_PICKER` / `RESOURCE_PICKER_RESULT` message pair.

  This generalizes the existing model-slot `OPEN_CHECKPOINT_PICKER` /
  `useCheckpointPicker` flow to App Block PAGES, and widens it from Checkpoint-only
  to a typed allowlist — v1 accepts `'Checkpoint' | 'LORA'` only
  (`BlockResourcePickerType`). The block asks the host to open its OWN native
  resource modal as host chrome; the user searches in host chrome (NOT the iframe);
  the host returns ONLY the single chosen resource as the narrow `BlockResourceInfo`
  (`{ versionId, modelId, baseModel, modelType }`). The iframe never receives the
  catalog, a list, or any resource it didn't pick.

  `@civitai/app-sdk` additions: `BlockResourceInfo`, `BlockResourcePickerType`, and
  the two message variants. `@civitai/blocks-react` adds `useResourcePicker()`
  whose `open({ resourceType, baseModelGroup? })` resolves with the chosen
  `BlockResourceInfo` or `null` when the user dismissed.

  Discovery only: the returned `versionId` is a hint, never an entitlement — feed
  it into `body.modelVersionId` (Checkpoint) or `body.additionalResources` (LoRA)
  and the host re-validates every id server-side at estimate/submit (the page gate

  - orchestrator belt). Purely additive and backward-compatible. The host side
    ships in civitai/civitai (`PageBlockHost` `OPEN_RESOURCE_PICKER` handler); a block
    can consume this hook once a version of these packages is published.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `useRequestSignIn()` — anonymous conversion. Returns
  `requestSignIn(payload?)`, a fire-and-forget helper that posts the new
  `REQUEST_SIGN_IN` message (`{ returnUrl?: string }`) through the active
  transport. A block rendered for a logged-out viewer (`viewer === null`) calls
  it when the user clicks an action that needs auth/money (e.g. Generate) so the
  host starts civitai.com's login flow. Pairs with `@civitai/app-sdk@^0.9`.

- Add `useRequestConsent()` — lazy consent. Returns `requestConsent(payload?)`,
  a fire-and-forget helper mirroring `useRequestSignIn()` that posts the new
  `REQUEST_CONSENT` message (`{ scopes?: string[] }`). A block rendered for a
  logged-in viewer whose token is missing a consent-gated scope calls it on the
  gated action (instead of prompting on load); the host opens its consent UI and,
  on grant, re-mints and pushes a `TOKEN_REFRESH` with the now-granted scopes so
  the block can retry.

- Suffix-wildcard support in the `IframeTransport` origin allowlist (new
  `internal/originMatcher`). The allowed-parent-origin list now accepts entries
  like `https://*.civitai.com`: a bare host still matches exactly; a `*.` prefix
  matches any subdomain of the suffix (never the apex unless listed separately,
  never a different registrable domain). Lets a block be embedded under
  preview/canary hosts without enumerating every one.

- Fix `peerDependencies["@civitai/app-sdk"]`: widened from `^0.7.0` (which
  excluded the `0.8.x`/`0.9.x` it is actually used with) to `>=0.7.0 <1`, so
  installing the current `@civitai/blocks-react` alongside the current
  `@civitai/app-sdk` no longer emits an unmet-peer-dependency warning.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- `useBuzzWorkflow` now gives the orchestrator-bound requests (`estimate` / `submit` / `poll`) a 120s timeout instead of the transport's 30s `DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`. `submit` does a whatif cost-preflight + the real submit (two orchestrator round-trips) plus a prompt audit server-side, which legitimately exceeds 30s on a busy generation queue — the old default surfaced that as a spurious `request "SUBMIT_WORKFLOW" timed out after 30000ms` rejection even though the submit was healthy.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Republish to fix `workspace:^` protocol leaking into `peerDependencies."@civitai/app-sdk"` of the 0.4.0 tarball — npm consumers got `EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL` on install. Replaced with explicit `^0.6.0` semver.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial public release of `@civitai/blocks-react` (0.4.0 — pre-1.0 v0): React hooks and iframe transport for Civitai App Blocks. Pairs with `@civitai/app-sdk/blocks` (the framework-agnostic contract) so block apps don't need to wire `postMessage` themselves.

  **Transport**

  - `IframeTransport` — origin-validated `postMessage` transport. Awaits `BLOCK_INIT` with a 10s timeout, queues outbound messages until init lands, correlates request/response by `requestId`, and auto-sends `BLOCK_READY` after applying init so the platform's 10s ready timeout doesn't fire on blocks that never explicitly send one (`useBlockResize` follows with real height measurements). Refuses to mount without at least one allowed parent origin. Every inbound payload passes a shape-validation gate (`payloadValidatorFor`) before reaching state-mutating code: malformed messages drop with `console.warn` instead of clobbering the token snapshot or producing `Invalid Date`. Handles both host-pushed `TOKEN_REFRESH` (no `requestId`) and `TOKEN_REFRESH_RESPONSE` (optional `requestId`); both replace the full wrapped token — scopes and `buzzBudget` included — not just `raw`/`expiresAt`.
  - `InlineTransport` — v2 stub. Reads `window.__CIVITAI_BLOCK_CONTEXT__`; not wired in v1.
  - `BlockTransportDetector.detect()` — picks iframe vs inline based on bootstrap presence; reads the allowlist from `VITE_` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_` / `PUBLIC_` env vars.
  - `getTransport()` — process-wide singleton so hooks share one instance.

  **Hooks**

  - `useBlockContext` — primary; returns the host-provided context, viewer (`ViewerInfo | null` — `null` for anonymous), theme (`'light' | 'dark'`), `appId`, `blockId`, `blockInstanceId`, and a `ready` gate.
  - `useBlockSettings`, `useBlockToken` (with `refresh()` for 401 retries and in-flight dedup so the scheduled and synchronous refresh paths never fan out duplicate `REQUEST_TOKEN` messages), `useBuzzWorkflow` (estimate/submit/poll with a shared terminal-status set so a host-returned `canceled` / `expired` snapshot exits `polling` correctly), `useBlockResize` (ResizeObserver → `RESIZE_IFRAME`), `useBuzzPurchase`, `useCivitaiNavigate`, `useBlockAnalytics`, `useCheckpointPicker`.

- Manifest-driven settings (W3 v0): `@civitai/blocks-react/ui` `SettingsForm` headless component. Renders a typed form from a `ManifestSettings` declaration, filters fields by scope + `requires_scope`, surfaces inline server-side validation errors, and delegates `resource_picker` widgets to the host via the existing `useCheckpointPicker` bridge.

- App Storage KV substrate (W4 v0): `useAppStorage()` hook with `get`, `set`, `delete`, `list`, `getQuota`. Anon viewers get a clean null on `get` + a thrown `UNAUTHORIZED` on `set`. Server-side enforces 50MB per-app quota and 64KB per-value cap. Pairs with the platform's per-app PostgreSQL schema (one schema per approved app block, isolated by a NOLOGIN role).

  Tracks `BlockInitPayload` and the postMessage protocol from civitai/civitai's `src/components/AppBlocks/types.ts` / `IframeHost.tsx` — viewer/theme/`appId` field layout and the wrapped-token shape match the platform contract.

  Peer-depends on `react ^18 || ^19` and `@civitai/app-sdk ^0.6`. Test surface covers origin validation, the 10s init timeout, requestId correlation, payload shape validation at the trust boundary (rejecting malformed `BLOCK_INIT` / `TOKEN_REFRESH` / `TOKEN_REFRESH_RESPONSE` / workflow replies), host-pushed token refresh, auto-`BLOCK_READY`, token-refresh scheduling + snapshot updates, the workflow state machine, the `SettingsForm` field rendering + validation, and the `useAppStorage` request/response cycle.
