# @civitai/blocks-react

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- f87da00: fix(testing): the dev `Harness` log badge no longer overlaps or intercepts the block's own bottom content. The fixed bottom-right badge now reserves matching bottom padding on the harness frame and is `pointer-events: none` (re-enabled only on the summary/log), so clicks on a block's last row of controls (e.g. action buttons) land on the controls instead of the badge.

## 0.10.0

### Minor Changes

- 216f3ca: `createMockHost`: rich, configurable scenario controls for local-dev DX (Layer 1).

  The mock host now lets a block dev exercise the full money / error / storage UX
  locally — synthetically, with no real Buzz and no network. All additions are
  optional and backward-compatible (existing `createMockHost({ viewer })` calls and
  the legacy `cost` / `failMode` / `buzzBudget` / `pollsUntilDone` knobs are
  unchanged).

  - **`generation`** scenario: `costPerGen` (number or `(body) => number`),
    `latencyMs` (number or `[min, max]`), `failRate` (0..1), `failNext` (fail the
    next N submits), and `image` / `images` (custom result URLs). Simulate real
    costs, slow gens, and failures.
  - **`buzz`** scenario: `balance` (a simulated spendable wallet — a gen that would
    exceed it returns an insufficient-Buzz outcome; successes debit it; a top-up
    refills it) and `insufficient` (force the insufficient path). Exercise the
    top-up / insufficient UX.
  - **`storage`** scenario + a working in-memory KV backend: the mock host now
    answers the full `APP_STORAGE_*` protocol (`get` / `set` / `delete` / `list`
    with cursor pagination / `getQuota`), with `seed`, `quotaBytes`,
    `valueCapBytes`, and `failNext` knobs. W4 KV apps (e.g. Prompt Library) can
    test load / quota / error states against `createMockHost` directly instead of
    hand-injecting a fake store.
  - **Runtime handle**: `createMockHost(...)` now returns `setScenario(patch)` plus
    a `buzz` handle (`getBalance()` / `setBalance(n)`) so a harness UI can flip
    scenarios mid-session.
  - `readMockHostUrlOptions` maps new query params onto the scenarios:
    `?balance`, `?insufficient`, `?latency` (`2000` or `500-2000`), `?costPerGen`,
    `?failNext`, `?failRate`, `?seed=<json>`.

  The mock host remains pure + synthetic (a test asserts the full protocol never
  calls `fetch`).

## 0.9.0

### Minor Changes

- 37d8465: Add `useDomainMaturity()` and `<SfwGate>` for reading the surrounding
  color-domain's maturity ceiling. `useDomainMaturity()` returns
  `{ domain, maxBrowsingLevel, isSfw, isLevelAllowed(level) }` from the same init
  state as `useBlockContext`, deriving `isSfw` from the `maxBrowsingLevel` bitmask
  (host PR #2670) and **failing closed to SFW** before `BLOCK_INIT` / when the host
  omits the field. `<SfwGate>` renders its children only when the domain is SFW (or
  when a given `level` is allowed), else an optional `fallback`. `createMockHost`
  now emits `domain`/`maxBrowsingLevel` on `BLOCK_INIT` (driven by `domain`,
  `maxBrowsingLevel`, or a `maturity: 'sfw'|'mature'` convenience) so the hook and
  gate are exercisable in tests and the dev harness. Additive only; forward-
  compatible (works before #2670 deploys). Requires `@civitai/app-sdk` >=0.13.0
  (for `isSfwCeiling`/`isLevelAllowed`/`ColorDomain` and the `browsingLevel`
  constants); the peer-dependency constraint is bumped accordingly.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- eca1252: Add `createMockHost()` + a React `<Harness>` (a.k.a. `<MockHostProvider>`) to the `@civitai/blocks-react/testing` subpath.

  `createMockHost()` is a framework-agnostic, test-and-dev-only fake of the civitai.com embedding host. It patches `window.parent.postMessage`, dispatches a configurable `BLOCK_INIT`, and answers the full block protocol — `REQUEST_TOKEN`, the lazy-consent `REQUEST_CONSENT` → `TOKEN_REFRESH` round-trip, `ESTIMATE_WORKFLOW`, `SUBMIT_WORKFLOW`, `POLL_WORKFLOW` (processing ×N → succeeded with image + cost), `OPEN_BUZZ_PURCHASE`, `OPEN_CHECKPOINT_PICKER`, and `OPEN_RESOURCE_PICKER` (canned picks). It is driven by an options object (`viewer`, `consentGranted`, `failMode`, `cannedPicks`, `pollsUntilDone`, `cost`, `theme`, `context`, + forward-compat `domain`/`maturity`) and also honors the dev URL toggles (`?viewer/?consent/?fail/?theme/?pick/?pickCkpt`). It returns an `{ install(): uninstall }` handle so it works from node/jsdom/happy-dom tests as well as a browser dev harness.

  `<Harness>` is a thin React wrapper that installs the mock host on mount (cleanup on unmount) and optionally renders the on-screen message-log panel.

  This replaces the ~250-line hand-rolled per-block harness. Test/dev-only — no change to the block runtime API or money/transport semantics. The existing `resetTransport` / `mockParentMessage` testing exports are unchanged.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 6ba78fa: Add the PAGE resource picker (Design 1 — host-chrome): `useResourcePicker()` +
  the `OPEN_RESOURCE_PICKER` / `RESOURCE_PICKER_RESULT` message pair.

  This generalizes the existing model-slot `OPEN_CHECKPOINT_PICKER` /
  `useCheckpointPicker` flow to App Block PAGES, and widens it from Checkpoint-only
  to a typed allowlist — v1 accepts `'Checkpoint' | 'LORA'` only
  (`BlockResourcePickerType`). The block asks the host to open its OWN native
  resource modal as host chrome; the user searches in host chrome (NOT the iframe);
  the host returns ONLY the single chosen resource as the narrow `BlockResourceInfo`
  (`{ versionId, modelId, baseModel, modelType }`). The iframe never receives the
  catalog, a list, or any resource it didn't pick.

  `@civitai/app-sdk` additions: `BlockResourceInfo`, `BlockResourcePickerType`, and
  the two message variants. `@civitai/blocks-react` adds `useResourcePicker()`
  whose `open({ resourceType, baseModelGroup? })` resolves with the chosen
  `BlockResourceInfo` or `null` when the user dismissed.

  Discovery only: the returned `versionId` is a hint, never an entitlement — feed
  it into `body.modelVersionId` (Checkpoint) or `body.additionalResources` (LoRA)
  and the host re-validates every id server-side at estimate/submit (the page gate

  - orchestrator belt). Purely additive and backward-compatible. The host side
    ships in civitai/civitai (`PageBlockHost` `OPEN_RESOURCE_PICKER` handler); a block
    can consume this hook once a version of these packages is published.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Add `useRequestSignIn()` — anonymous conversion. Returns
  `requestSignIn(payload?)`, a fire-and-forget helper that posts the new
  `REQUEST_SIGN_IN` message (`{ returnUrl?: string }`) through the active
  transport. A block rendered for a logged-out viewer (`viewer === null`) calls
  it when the user clicks an action that needs auth/money (e.g. Generate) so the
  host starts civitai.com's login flow. Pairs with `@civitai/app-sdk@^0.9`.

- Add `useRequestConsent()` — lazy consent. Returns `requestConsent(payload?)`,
  a fire-and-forget helper mirroring `useRequestSignIn()` that posts the new
  `REQUEST_CONSENT` message (`{ scopes?: string[] }`). A block rendered for a
  logged-in viewer whose token is missing a consent-gated scope calls it on the
  gated action (instead of prompting on load); the host opens its consent UI and,
  on grant, re-mints and pushes a `TOKEN_REFRESH` with the now-granted scopes so
  the block can retry.

- Suffix-wildcard support in the `IframeTransport` origin allowlist (new
  `internal/originMatcher`). The allowed-parent-origin list now accepts entries
  like `https://*.civitai.com`: a bare host still matches exactly; a `*.` prefix
  matches any subdomain of the suffix (never the apex unless listed separately,
  never a different registrable domain). Lets a block be embedded under
  preview/canary hosts without enumerating every one.

- Fix `peerDependencies["@civitai/app-sdk"]`: widened from `^0.7.0` (which
  excluded the `0.8.x`/`0.9.x` it is actually used with) to `>=0.7.0 <1`, so
  installing the current `@civitai/blocks-react` alongside the current
  `@civitai/app-sdk` no longer emits an unmet-peer-dependency warning.

## 0.4.2

### Patch Changes

- `useBuzzWorkflow` now gives the orchestrator-bound requests (`estimate` / `submit` / `poll`) a 120s timeout instead of the transport's 30s `DEFAULT_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS`. `submit` does a whatif cost-preflight + the real submit (two orchestrator round-trips) plus a prompt audit server-side, which legitimately exceeds 30s on a busy generation queue — the old default surfaced that as a spurious `request "SUBMIT_WORKFLOW" timed out after 30000ms` rejection even though the submit was healthy.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Republish to fix `workspace:^` protocol leaking into `peerDependencies."@civitai/app-sdk"` of the 0.4.0 tarball — npm consumers got `EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL` on install. Replaced with explicit `^0.6.0` semver.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial public release of `@civitai/blocks-react` (0.4.0 — pre-1.0 v0): React hooks and iframe transport for Civitai App Blocks. Pairs with `@civitai/app-sdk/blocks` (the framework-agnostic contract) so block apps don't need to wire `postMessage` themselves.

  **Transport**

  - `IframeTransport` — origin-validated `postMessage` transport. Awaits `BLOCK_INIT` with a 10s timeout, queues outbound messages until init lands, correlates request/response by `requestId`, and auto-sends `BLOCK_READY` after applying init so the platform's 10s ready timeout doesn't fire on blocks that never explicitly send one (`useBlockResize` follows with real height measurements). Refuses to mount without at least one allowed parent origin. Every inbound payload passes a shape-validation gate (`payloadValidatorFor`) before reaching state-mutating code: malformed messages drop with `console.warn` instead of clobbering the token snapshot or producing `Invalid Date`. Handles both host-pushed `TOKEN_REFRESH` (no `requestId`) and `TOKEN_REFRESH_RESPONSE` (optional `requestId`); both replace the full wrapped token — scopes and `buzzBudget` included — not just `raw`/`expiresAt`.
  - `InlineTransport` — v2 stub. Reads `window.__CIVITAI_BLOCK_CONTEXT__`; not wired in v1.
  - `BlockTransportDetector.detect()` — picks iframe vs inline based on bootstrap presence; reads the allowlist from `VITE_` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_` / `PUBLIC_` env vars.
  - `getTransport()` — process-wide singleton so hooks share one instance.

  **Hooks**

  - `useBlockContext` — primary; returns the host-provided context, viewer (`ViewerInfo | null` — `null` for anonymous), theme (`'light' | 'dark'`), `appId`, `blockId`, `blockInstanceId`, and a `ready` gate.
  - `useBlockSettings`, `useBlockToken` (with `refresh()` for 401 retries and in-flight dedup so the scheduled and synchronous refresh paths never fan out duplicate `REQUEST_TOKEN` messages), `useBuzzWorkflow` (estimate/submit/poll with a shared terminal-status set so a host-returned `canceled` / `expired` snapshot exits `polling` correctly), `useBlockResize` (ResizeObserver → `RESIZE_IFRAME`), `useBuzzPurchase`, `useCivitaiNavigate`, `useBlockAnalytics`, `useCheckpointPicker`.

- Manifest-driven settings (W3 v0): `@civitai/blocks-react/ui` `SettingsForm` headless component. Renders a typed form from a `ManifestSettings` declaration, filters fields by scope + `requires_scope`, surfaces inline server-side validation errors, and delegates `resource_picker` widgets to the host via the existing `useCheckpointPicker` bridge.

- App Storage KV substrate (W4 v0): `useAppStorage()` hook with `get`, `set`, `delete`, `list`, `getQuota`. Anon viewers get a clean null on `get` + a thrown `UNAUTHORIZED` on `set`. Server-side enforces 50MB per-app quota and 64KB per-value cap. Pairs with the platform's per-app PostgreSQL schema (one schema per approved app block, isolated by a NOLOGIN role).

  Tracks `BlockInitPayload` and the postMessage protocol from civitai/civitai's `src/components/AppBlocks/types.ts` / `IframeHost.tsx` — viewer/theme/`appId` field layout and the wrapped-token shape match the platform contract.

  Peer-depends on `react ^18 || ^19` and `@civitai/app-sdk ^0.6`. Test surface covers origin validation, the 10s init timeout, requestId correlation, payload shape validation at the trust boundary (rejecting malformed `BLOCK_INIT` / `TOKEN_REFRESH` / `TOKEN_REFRESH_RESPONSE` / workflow replies), host-pushed token refresh, auto-`BLOCK_READY`, token-refresh scheduling + snapshot updates, the workflow state machine, the `SettingsForm` field rendering + validation, and the `useAppStorage` request/response cycle.
